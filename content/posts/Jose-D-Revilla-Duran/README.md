# About Me

![](./abaroa_mXE6nmTk.jpg)

I’m mostly interested in games as narrative experiences from adventure games to visual novels, point-and-click, and puzzles as well as evocative experiences.

When I’m not working I’m interested in interacting and learning from different cultures, their legends, their stories, and the occult in general, I also like to experiment in the kitchen and consuming every kind of media.

If you like my work (or want to talk about the multiculturalism in Bolivia) please contact me :)
